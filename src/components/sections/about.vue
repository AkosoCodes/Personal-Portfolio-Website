                I'm Andrija, a third-year student striving to become a software engineer. My main passion is connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, individuals from different teams, or applications from various industries. <br><br>
                
                My interest in tech started way back since I could remember. As any other kid, I was inquisitive  with how things work. Whether it'd be electronics, or video games, my curiousity would guide me on a journy to find and understand the logic behind it.<br><br>
        
                Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve been enjoying the process of diversifying my skillsets in various fields. My main focus these days is on <span class="text-accent">Web Development</span> as working with different technologies and languages to build one product is a puzzle which I enjoy to solve.<br><br>
